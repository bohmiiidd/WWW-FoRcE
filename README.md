### `WWW-FoRcE`



**WWW-FoRcE** is a Python-based tool designed for directory and file brute-forcing on web servers. It can test proxies, use random user-agents, and include delays to mimic human behavior and reduce detectability. This tool is useful for penetration testers and security researchers to discover hidden resources on web applications.

## Features

- **Directory and File Brute-Forcing**: Automatically test common directories and files on a target URL.
- **Proxy Support**: Test proxies before starting brute-forcing and use them to avoid IP blocking.
- **Random User-Agents**: Use randomized user-agent strings to avoid detection.
- **Human-like Delays**: Introduce delays between requests to simulate human browsing behavior.
- **Status Code Reporting**: Provides detailed feedback on the HTTP status codes received.

## Installation

To get started with WWW-FoRcE, you'll need to install the required Python packages. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content and use `pip` to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Environment**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed and the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Run the Tool**: Execute the script and follow the prompts to input the target URL, wordlist path, and any additional options for proxy, user-agent, and delay.

   ```bash
   python www_force.py
   ```

3. **Input Options**: You'll be prompted to enter:
   - Target URL (e.g., `http://example.com`)
   - Path to wordlist
   - Whether to use a proxy, random user-agent, and delay

4. **Results**: The script will display found directories and files, and report proxy functionality.

## License

This tool is provided as-is for educational and research purposes. Use it responsibly and ensure you have permission to test the target systems.
